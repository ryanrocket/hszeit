### Progressive Web Application For Creating Clean HTML Head's

## Starting // Run
It's the same as any other node/vue application.

`npm run serve`<br />
This will run the web serve on port 9000

## For Contributers
I included a Makefile to make procedures easier.<br />
`make commit` will commit all changes to the beta branch<br />
`make purge-modules` will remove the node_modules if it exists<br />
